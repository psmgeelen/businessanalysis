# Basic Operations script
#
# In this script the basic operations are described and explained. The basic syntax of
# R is developed around "," (comma) seperations and "()" (bracket) grouping. In general 
# the syntax (grammar of programming language) is similar to 
#
# object <- function(parameter1, vector2, dataframe3)
#
# In which is an object is the "thing" in which results can be stored, the function is 
# something by which the information is processed (usually relates to a library), a
# parameter which is this case is a value, a vector which is the same as a variable (a 
# sequence of values) and a dataframe which is identical to a flat-table (just like a
# sheet in excel is). Good to know is that R has simmplified datastructures that are all
# compatable with each other.
